# Documentation for the Dice Project

The purpose of the dice project is to facilitate the process of generating random numbers.

The die project should provide the user with the ability to select the type of die that they want to use.

Some of the die options that are available include D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20. There is also the possibility to create a custom die.

The program should allow for rolling a die to revil the new random number, shake a die to generate a random number before rolling, get the current face of a die, to get the type of die that is being used or to set the face of a die.

The test for the die program have been written using the default unittest library that comes preinstalled in python. 

We can run the tests using the following command:

`python -m unittest`
